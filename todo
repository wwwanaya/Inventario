then I sent it to php and simple as that.
and remember to put data-dismiss="modal" to hide the modal before click save.

OK.
How to not use value="id"
Store a php session and then
create a array with the data from the server.
i.e.
$brands = array[brand_id = 1, brand_name = hp]
And then, BEFORE make the SQL query I'll check if the HTML data integrity is
what I put there...
i.e.
User select a brand_id = 2 but with the brand_name = HP. This will fool the server...
So, If user selection brand id is 2, if 2 in the array exist? Yes... If the ID 2 in the array match with
the brand_name with is HP? NO it doesn't match, ID 2 is GENERIC.
